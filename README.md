# My very own `dotfiles`

A repository to bootstrap my MacOS machine (dev environment and more general apps I use or like).

I could have used [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks but I felt like trying something else.

## Platforms

- MacOS (main target)
- GitHub Codespaces (diluted target, not setup yet)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository

   You need `git` already installed on your machine, on MacOS, you have a default version packaged by Apple.

2. Run the following script to install [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) (your password manager):

   ```sh
   ./bootstrap
   ```

3. Create a new SSH key with:

   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "c.yoann@gmail.com"
   ```

   Copy the public key with:

   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
   ```

   Upload it to your GitHub account twice, as a SSH key and as a signing key.

4. Finally, you can run this last script to bootstrap your machine:

   ```sh
   ./install
   ```

   You will need to sign out and sign in again for some settings to apply.

   Most apps will be installed already and your shell (`fish`) setup in `iterm2`.
